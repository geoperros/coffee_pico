This is an simple project to help me modernise my espresso machine in order to brew shots and stop in a set time.
The espresso machine is a san marco practical 85 with a switch operating the brewing.
The switching is done with a double relay which is connected in parallel to the manual switch, operated by a raspberry pi pico.
